            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>12 ounces shredded cheese, (about 3 cups) cheddar, Monterey jack, Mexican cheese blend, or a combination</li>
            <li>8 large flour tortillas</li>
            <li>Optional, for serving: fresh cilantro, chopped green or red onion, sour cream, avocado, pico de gallo, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350° F. </li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it starts to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked chicken, black beans, diced green chiles, chili powder, cumin, dried oregano, salt and ½ cup of enchilada sauce to the skillet. Stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Grease a 9×13-inch baking dish and spread ½ cup of enchilada sauce over the bottom of the dish. To assemble each enchilada, take one of the tortillas and put ½ cup of the chicken and bean mixture down the middle of the tortilla, slightly to the side of the center. Top with ⅓ cup of cheese.</li>
            <li>Roll up the tortilla as tightly as you can. Put the enchilada, seam side down, in the prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas, enchilada filling and cheese.</li>
            <li>Spread the remaining sauce over the tops of the enchiladas. Sprinkle on the remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake enchiladas for 20-25 minutes, until hot and bubbly. Let rest for 5 minutes and then serve, with toppings as desired.</li>
